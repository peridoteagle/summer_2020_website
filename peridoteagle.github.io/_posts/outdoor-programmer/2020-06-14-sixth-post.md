Working remotely outdoors requires some creative solutions.

{% include toc.html %}

I am grateful that my work as a data scientist allows me to work remotely.
In coming north to New Hampshire to live in a tent, I knew that I might
not have a dedicated indoor workspace. So, I worked with my dad to
create a suitable outdoor workspace (pictured above). The key pieces of
this workspace:

1. **Consistent WiFi**: as part of my job, I need access to the internet for tasks
such as collaborating on projects (GitHub), sending emails, and
attending Zoom meetings. Though I looked at a variety of options that
RV owners use to get WiFi for an RV with an intent to get WiFi for the
tent, the cheapest and most realistic option was to use my dad's home
WiFi and set up a workspace near his house. This did still require
the use of a WiFi extender to extend the range of the WiFi.
2. **Power:** Zoom meetings are a huge power drain. Luckily, my dad
let me run an extension cord through a window (that I unplug at the
end of each workday to prevent electricity accidents).
3. **Shade:** working outside can be very annoying when the sunlight
makes it impossible to see a laptop screen. Luckily, we had a
tent canopy that was perfect for this set up. We placed it on a
flat area near trees for additional shade.
4. **Air Movement:** moving air is very helpful to keep bugs away
and to stay cool. I got a fan that can also be plugged into the same
extension cord used for the computer.
5. **Comfy Chair:** I have commandeered a porch chair as my office chair
and added a comfy weather-resistant cushion.
6. **Small Table:** found a small table that is super useful for holding
items, such as my computer during Zoom meetings
7. **Bird Sounds:** The birds are surprisingly loud, and while I enjoy
them, I mostly mute myself in Zoom meetings so as not to distract
others :)

My favorite part of working outside is seeing, hearing, and feeling
the transitions of the day. When working in my office or apartment,
I would sometimes get so absorbed in programming that I didn't notice that a
day had gone by. When I work outside, I enjoy taking a break to walk
around, listen to the birds, or simply observe nature.
