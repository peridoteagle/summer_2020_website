It's a newt!

{% include toc.html %}

I used to see many red efts as a child, but I haven't seen one in years, so I was pretty excited when I spotted this bright orange red eft on a path to the stream. While brightly colored, the newt made no effort to run away. This is potentially because the newt does not fear many predators - it's skin produces toxins that can impact nerves, even in humans. The red eft phase is actually the juvenile phase of the Eastern newt. If the red eft survives 2020, in 2021 or 2022 it will likely seek out water, grow a longer tail, and transform into the adult phase.
