One of the most delicious times of the year!

{% include toc.html %}

It's strawberry season in New Hampshire! My sister is working at a local vegetable farm this summer that also has strawberries for sale, as well as pick-your-own strawberries. Picking strawberries was a little different with masks on this year, but still a lot of fun! We had strawberry shortcake afterwards which is one of my favorite summer desserts.
