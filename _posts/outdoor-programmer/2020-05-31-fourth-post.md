Weather, water, wildlife, and other considerations for choosing a platform tent site.

{% include toc.html %}

When choosing a platform tent site, we wanted to think long term. With proper care, a platform and associated tent can last more than 15 years. Our final choice is pictured above. Some of the items that we considered when choosing a tent site included:

**Terrain**: we selected a flat area for our tent site to facilitate easy construction

**Accessibility**: the platform tent needed to be accessible by vehicle to easily facilitate construction of the platform, delivery of the tent, and regular use. One step we took to improve accessibility of our selected tent site was to arrange a delivery of stones for a section of the unofficial road to the field that was prone to flooding.

**Sunlight**: we chose a site that receives early morning sun and is shaded in the afternoon

**Nearby Trees**: we selected a site away from some tall, older trees that could fall and damage the tent or platform, but near enough to trees that they could provide some protection in lightning storms

**Bugs**: while bugs are unavoidable, we chose a flat area where we could mow and use pesticides to reduce the chances of Lyme disease infection from ticks

**Water**: we are fortunate to have the Blow-Me-Down Brook alongside our property, and we chose a site that was a short walk from the stream since the stream is fun to swim in and observe

**Wildlife**: wildlife including deer and coyotes frequently visit the field, and on rare instances bear or moose could pass through, so we chose a location that was a good distance away from shrubbery and undergrowth

After selecting our final site, we mowed it, spread tick pesticides, and prepared the access road to get to the site. Itâ€™s exciting to get closer to our goal!
