Birds, fireflies, and fun!

{% include toc.html %}

First week in the tent is complete! I must admit that I was a bit nervous about being so isolated, but I found that I loved it. I particularly love the mornings. The sun starts hitting the tent around 5 AM. The birds are wonderfully loud. I feel so alive as I start the morning.

At night, the fireflies light up the fields. Interestingly, I've heard people in North Caroline call them lightning bugs. Check out this [data visualization and discussion](https://www.businessinsider.com/firefly-lightning-bug-english-language-map-2018-7) of where *firefly* is used versus *lightning bug* and the potential reasons for the regional difference. Whatever you want to call the bug, it's pretty magical to watch hundreds of tiny insects light up the night.

At this point, the campsite includes a tent platform and tent, a kitchen tent with cooking items, and a fire pit that my mom and I just constructed this past weekend using rocks from an old stone wall. We also spent some time clearing out space near the brook to put up a some chairs and a screened tent to enjoy the babbling brook. And I took some time to go swimming in the crystal clear brook with our golden retriever, Sadie, too! It's been a fun first week.
