Reflecting on the history of tents, their modern use, and the privilege of choosing to live in a tent.

{% include toc.html %}

Humans have used tents - fabric or other materials such as animal pelts draped over a frame or ropes - since the Iron Age. Tents are generally easy to construct and move, offer some protection from the elements, and are typically cheaper than permanent structures. Today, tents are often thought of when used for recreation like hiking, camping, and biking.

Yet tents have an incredibly rich history of use that extends far beyond modern recreation. For thousands of years, many cultures including Native American and Aboriginal Canadian tribes utilized tents of various types for living and ceremonial purposes. Protest movements have used tents to occupy land and launch movements. Armies have used tents as part of their strategy to deploy rapidly. Emergency response teams use tents to facilitate an immediate response to humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters. Unhoused residents living across the world from streets in large cities to refugee camps rely on tents as their main living quarters.

I recognize the privilege that I have as a young, white, able-bodied woman choosing to live in a tent, particularly when I could instead choose to live in an apartment or a similar structure. I am making choices to invest in a quality tent and construction assistance that others do not have. In reflecting on this choice, I decided to make a recurring monthly financial commitment to the following organizations that support shelter:
* [Housing for New Hope](https://www.housingfornewhope.org/): supports rapid re-housing, permanent supportive housing, and affordable housing in the Durham community
* [Annunciation House](https://annunciationhouse.org/): supports hospitality including emergency shelter for migrants, immigrants, and refugees in the El Paso border region
