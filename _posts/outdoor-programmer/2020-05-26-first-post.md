A number of years ago, I spent two summers working as a counselor at a sleep-away camp in Vermont. One of my favorite parts of the job was living in a canvas platform tent for eight weeks. I woke up to the morning cacophony of songbirds in the pine trees and fell asleep to the woeful wails of loons on the lake. I could feel the rays of sunlight when the sun rose and the boom of thunder when a storm passed overhead. I felt both more connected to myself and to the world.

In this crazy time of staying at home during COVID19, many of us have experienced how the days blur together. We look up, and another week has passed. In the past two months, I’ve spent more time on computer and phone screens than ever before, and yet I feel incredibly disconnected. I’ve missed my family and I’ve longed to be outside.

And so, I worked out a plan with my parents. I’d move back to New England for the summer (observing state COVID19 policies) and build a canvas platform tent on a corner of the property. The tent could encompass all that I was seeking: safely spending time with my family members, continuing my work as a remote data scientist, and being outside.

And so the adventure begins. There’s much to figure out, including tent construction, coyote avoidance, and the ever-present threat of ticks. But even with all the new tasks, I’ve already felt the stress of the last few months lift from my shoulders. Perhaps environmentalist John Muir captured it best when he said, “The clearest way into the Universe is thru a forest wilderness”.
