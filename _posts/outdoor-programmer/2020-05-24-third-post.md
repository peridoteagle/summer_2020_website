A packing list for living in a tent longer-term.

{% include toc.html %}

Before moving into a tent, I inventoried the various camping items I’ve acquired over the years. Many of these were purchased used, found in thrift stores, or passed down by family members. Others have been purchased at outdoor sections in places like Walmart, LL Bean, and REI.

When living in a tent longer term, it is important to consider that you may experience a variety of weather conditions including cold, hot, rainy, and windy weather. It may at times be challenging to access stores or laundry. Since I traveled by car, it was easier to allow myself to overpack (as compared to backpacking which requires more strategic choices).

Here’s the list I used to get started:

**Clothing**
* T-shirts and tank tops (including some polyester because cotton is not good for hiking)
* Shorts (casual and sport)
* Socks, including wool for hiking
* Leggings
* Underwear
* Sports bras
* Sweatshirt and sweatpants (for when it is cold)
* Sleeping clothes
* Rain jacket and rain pants
* Hiking pants
* Casual wear: jeans, shirt, summer dress

**Footwear**
* Tevas, or similar sandals to wear around the campsite
* Crocs, or similar lightweight water shoes
* Hiking boots
* Rock climbing shoes
* Sneakers
* Flip flops

**Outdoor Activities**
* Hiking poles
* Climbing helmet, harness, gear
* Tent
* Sleeping bag, pad, and pillow
* Hammock and tree ties
* Day hike backpack
* Overnight hiking backpack
* Swimsuits
* Beach towel and quick dry towel

**Food-Related Items**
* Camping stove
* Various pots and pans
* Cooking utensils and cutting board
* Bear-resistant container
* Small cooler

**Power**
* Solar phone charger
* Flashlight
* Lantern
* Battery pack

**Health-Related Items**
* First aid kit
* Sunscreen
* Bug spray
* Water bottles

**Misc**
* Laundry bag
* Frisbee
* Air horn (for wildlife)
* Toolkit with hammer and utility knife
