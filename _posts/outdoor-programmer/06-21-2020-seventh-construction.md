Constructing the tent platform!

{% include toc.html %}

Super excited about the construction of the tent platform! We worked with two awesome folks (Jen and Geoff) from the Aloha Foundation for assistance in building this tent platform. We discussed orienting it towards the morning sun and choosing a site that was far enough away from trees that might fall.

There was some concern that we might not get enough decking since many people are building decks right now, but we got lucky and new decking came in the day before platform construction! The crew was able to construct the entire platform in half a day! Incredible. It is very sturdy construction and mounted on cement blocks so the platform can be moved in the future if needed.
