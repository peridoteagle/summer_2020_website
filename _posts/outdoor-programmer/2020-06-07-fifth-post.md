Tent life can have a dangerous side.

{% include toc.html %}

Living in a tent can be dangerous. There are concerns that I have that I don't typically think about. For example, the picture above is an image of water pooling in my tent after a rainstorm. This is dangerous as stagnant water can lead to mosquitos or disease, and a wet tent is less than ideal. Here are some other concerns and steps I am taking to manage them:

1. **Lightning:** This is one of my biggest concerns, especially in my initial tent with metal tent poles and a metal cot. I've known people who have been seriously injured and killed by lighting. This is a danger that cannot be taken lightly. My plan is to go to my dad's house when there is a lightning storm.
2. **Lyme Disease:** Also a major concern. Lyme disease is a serious infection caused by bacteria that are carried by ticks. While Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught early, untreated Lyme disease can lead to [nerve damage and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html). My plan is to wear leggings and socks whenever possible and to do daily tick checks.
3. **Bear Attack:** Black bear attacks are unusual but not unheard of in New Hampshire. To prevent bear attacks, I keep minimal food at the campsite and store it in a bear canister.
4. **Mosquito-Borne Disease:** West Nile virus and EEE are both mosquito borne diseases that are known to exist in New England. EEE is [especially dangerous](https://onezero.medium.com/a-deadly-mosquito-borne-illness-is-brewing-in-the-northeast-d3283c71c6a0) because though it is rare, it has a high fatality rate. I plan to wear bug spray and minimize time outdoors at the dusk hours when the mosquitos are the most busy.

Some items that are more straightforward when compared to camping in other places:
* Connectivity: My cellphone gets service as the tent site
* Health Emergencies: I am 30 minutes by car from a hospital
* People: I am within walking distance (1/4 mile) of my family and staying on family property

Nature experiences can be a lot of fun, but they can also quickly get dangerous. I find that I can have fun and still be safe when I recognize the dangers, manage the factors that are manageable, and be aware of the factors that are outside of my control.
